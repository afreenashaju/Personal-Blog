        <h3 class="head1"><srtong>May 24 2023</strong></h3>
         <p>2  weeks  Learning  Bootcamp  named  <strong> UPSKILL 2.0 </strong> was  conducted  by  the  TinkerHub  club  of  my  college.
          This  learning  phase  was  from  May  24  2023  to  June  8  2023 . I  was  excited  to  embark  on  this  journey  of  skill  development.
         Moreover  for  me  this  was  an  oppurtunity  to  find  out  my  skills  and  unleash  my  true  potential.
          I've  had  a  great  experience  from  this  journey . This  programme  provided  me  the  oppurtunity  to  learn  Web  Designing , Flutter  and  UX . I  was  interested
         in  Web Designing  and  hence chose  that . Through  this  journey  I  have  gained  a  lot  of knowledge  about  web  designing .
         I  didn’t  know  much  about  web  development. 
          So  I  took  this  as  an  opportunity  to  learn  something  new  that  I  hadn’t  learned  in  my  school  days.
          After  a little  bit  of  research ,  I  came  to  know  about  things  like  HTML  and  CSS.
         My  learning  started  with  the  review  of  HTML  and  CSS.
         I  also  had  a  brief  session  on   GIT  to  understand  the  basics  of  GIT . Then  I  had  a  session  on  HTML  to  know
         more  about  it . Then  I  learnt  CSS  and  then  bootstrap . We  were  given  activities  on  this  for  practice.
         Firstly  we  were  asked  to  make  a  webpage  using  HTML , then  using  CSS . At  last  we  made  a  sign  up  page 
         using  bootstrap . In  conclusion , my  journey  of  2  weeks  as  a  web  developer  
         has  been  full  of  training  and  learning  new  things , and  I  am  loving  every  part  of  it. I would  like  to  thank  my  mentor,  my senior , 
             Chaitanya  for  being  the  guiding  light throughout  my  journey. 
             She  was  very  helpful  and  cleared  all  my  doubts  on  time. She  was  extremely  understanding  and
             patient  in  imparting  her  knowledge  to  make  my  learning 
              more  efficient.
