        <h3 class="head1"><srtong>May 24 2023</strong></h3>
         <p>2  weeks  Learning  Bootcamp  named  <strong> UPSKILL 2.0 </strong> was  conducted  by  the  TinkerHub  club  of  my  college.
          This  learning  phase  was  from  May  24  2023  to  June  8  2023 . I  was  so  much  excited  to  embark  on  this  journey  of  skill  development.
         Moreover  for  me  this  was  an  oppurtunity  to  find  out  my  skills  and  unleash  my  true  potential.
          I  had  a  great  experience  from  this  journey . This  programme  provided  us  the  oppurtunity  to  learn  Web  Designing , Flutter  and  UX . I  was  interested
         in  Web Designing  so  I  have  choosen  that . Through  this  journey  i  have  gained  a  lot  about  web  designing .
         I  didn’t  know  much  about  web  development. 
          So  I  took  this  as  an  opportunity  to  learn  something  new  that  I  hadn’t  learned  in  my  school  days.
          After  a  little  bit  of  research ,  I  came  to  know  about  things  like  HTML  and  CSS.
         My  learning  started  with  the  review  of  HTML  and  css.
         I  also  had  a  brief  session  on   GIT  to  understand  the  basics  of  GIT . Then  I  had  session  on  HTML  to  know
         more  about . Then  i  learnt  CSS  then  the  bootstrap . We  were  given  the  activities  on  this  to  make  us  practice.
         Firstly  we  were  asked  to  make  a  webpage  using  html , then  using  css . At  last  we  made  a  sign  up  page 
         using  the  bootstrap . In  conclusion , my  journey  of  2  weeks  as  a  web  developer  
         has  been  full  of  training  and  learning  new  things , and  I  am  loving  every  part  of  it.
